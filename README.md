https://www.raywenderlich.com/21512310-calling-native-libraries-in-flutter-with-dart-ffi

In the process, youâ€™ll learn:

1. About FFI and how it lets Dart code invoke code written in other languages.
2. How FFI differs from Flutter platform channels.
3. To automatically compile and link C code when building a Flutter app.
4. How a Flutter app can use FFI to call code written in C.

1. Wrote a C function.
2. Compiled this function into a shared object and linked it into your Flutter app.
3. Used FFI to locate the library and function signature.
4. Bound the native function to a Dart function.
5. Invoked the Dart function to return a double from the C function.

3. Converts these values to Celsius if useCelsius is true.
4. Returns the struct.
